Hi! I'm a first year PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania within the
Computer & Information Science department, where I'm extremely fortunate to be advised by [Konrad Kording](https://koerding.com/) and [Danae Metaxa](https://metaxa.net/). Prior to Penn, I did my undergrad at UC Berkeley in Computer Science (and a small but mighty minor in Public Policy!).
